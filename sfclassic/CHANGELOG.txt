  o By default, players spawn with no grenades. This is a feature easy to abuse and it was added mostly for fun.
  o The smoke grenade behaves differently from Sourceforts 1.9.4.1 mostly due to changes in Source SDK itself. This might never be fixed.
  o It's easy to abuse this feature (with suicides/respawns). Don't turn it on, on public servers.
  o I'm still considering adding a limit timer to it, but might be more trouble than it's worth.
- Added ar2 alt fire (combine ball) back in
  o This should be considered a Fun feature! It shouldn't ever be enabled on public servers or competitive play!
  o Added `sf_soldier_combineball_enabled` console variable to control if the player can actually shoot combine balls. Default: 0
  o Added `sf_soldier_combineball` console variable to control the amount of ammo the player will spawn. (Will not work if `sf_soldier_combineball_enabled` is set to 0!). Default: 0
  o This "double lock" variable system might be silly, but it's easier to prevent an exploit that way.
