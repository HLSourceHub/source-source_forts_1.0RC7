SourceForts 1.9.6 Custom Console Variables
==========================================

This file contains a list of custom console commands and variables added to SourceForts.
Since many of those were never oficially documented, the meaning of some of them might be lost in time or misunderstood.


New Variables, Added in SourceForts Classic 1.0
-----------------------------------------------

Most of these were added to re-enable features that were cut or are disabled by default in SourceForts 1.9.6.
These are meant only to be used for fun purposes and shouldn't ever be enabled in public servers or in league matches!

* sf_soldier_combineball
  * Default: 0
  * [Fun] Allow Soldiers to spawn with AR2 alt-fire (combine balls) ammo (0-3). This shouldn't ever be enabled in public or competitive matches! Default: 0

* sf_scout_smoke_grenade
  * Default: 0
  * [Experimental] When a Scout player spawn, it spawn with this amount (0-3) grenades. Default: 0

* sf_freezestatus_extended
  * Default: 0
  * Displays the SteamID64 of the last block frozer/unfrozer when inspecting a block with the build gun

* sv_curl_redhat_linux_compatible
  * Default: 1
  * [Server Side Only] Use local `cacert.pem` file.
    This is required by RedHat-based Linux distros (CentOS, Amazon, etc.).
    You should disable this if you're not using those distros.
    Enable this if you're getting CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE curl errors on logs.
    This variable has no effect on Windows.
